# Validate annotation repository inputs (no writes).
#
# This checks that:
# - `annotations/config.json` has the expected structure/version
# - each per-user file under `annotations/users/*.json` is well-formed and
#   consistent (e.g. username matches `githubUserId`)
# - optional author-only merges file (if present) is valid
#
# The goal is to fail fast on malformed JSON or schema violations before they
# reach the Cellucid UI (or other tooling consuming this repo).
